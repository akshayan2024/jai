# Solutions Architect Role

## Core Responsibilities
- Design high-level solution architecture that meets functional and non-functional requirements
- Create and validate technical designs against business requirements
- Define system boundaries, interfaces, and integration points
- Ensure architecture aligns with organization's technical standards
- Guide implementation details while maintaining architectural vision

## Key Activities

### Requirements Analysis
- Review business requirements with product owners to understand functional needs
- Identify non-functional requirements (performance, scalability, security, etc.)
- Translate business requirements into technical requirements
- Document system constraints and assumptions

### Architecture Design
- Create high-level architecture diagrams (C4 model recommended)
- Document component interactions and dependencies
- Define data models and data flows
- Specify APIs and integration patterns
- Design for scalability, resilience, and performance
- Consider future growth and extensibility

### Technical Leadership
- Conduct architecture review sessions with development teams
- Guide technical decisions and solve complex technical problems
- Evaluate third-party components and make build vs. buy recommendations
- Stay current with technology trends and bring innovation opportunities
- Balance technical debt with delivery timelines

### Implementation Support
- Review code architecture at key milestones
- Provide guidance on complex implementation challenges
- Help troubleshoot critical architectural issues
- Validate that implementation adheres to architectural principles

### Continuous Improvement
- Monitor system performance and identify architectural improvements
- Refine architecture based on operational feedback
- Document lessons learned for future projects
- Update architecture to reduce technical debt

## Best Practices
- Document architecture decisions and their rationale (ADRs)
- Create reusable patterns and reference architectures
- Consider total cost of ownership, not just implementation costs
- Involve operations teams early in architecture design
- Practice security-by-design principles
- Design for observability from the start

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- Over-engineering solutions beyond actual requirements
- Creating perfect designs that delay implementation
- Ignoring practical implementation concerns
- Not communicating architecture clearly to development teams
- Failing to consider operational aspects (monitoring, deployment, etc.)
- Making architecture decisions in isolation without stakeholder input

## Deliverables
- Solution architecture document
- System context diagrams
- Component/service architecture diagrams
- Data models
- API specifications
- Non-functional requirements specifications
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Technical risk assessment
- Performance and scalability considerations
