# JAI API Testing Strategy

This directory contains all tests for the JAI API. The testing architecture follows a structured approach to ensure comprehensive coverage.

## Test Organization

- **test_api.py**: API endpoint tests for basic functionality
- **test_componentized.py**: Unit tests for individual components and services
- **test_server_componentized.py**: Mock server implementation for integration testing
- **test_all.py**: End-to-end tests covering all features
- **conftest.py**: Shared test fixtures and utilities

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

To run specific test files:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_api.py
```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components 
3. **API Tests**: Verify endpoints and response structures
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows from request to response

## Test Standards

- Each test function should focus on testing one specific functionality
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test edge cases (e.g., boundary values, error conditions)
- Use fixtures for shared test data and setup

## Adding New Tests

When adding new features:

1. Add unit tests for the new functionality
2. Add API tests for new endpoints
3. Update end-to-end tests to include the new feature
4. Ensure backward compatibility is maintained

## CI/CD Integration

Tests are automatically run as part of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality before deployment.

## Coverage Goals

- Aim for at least 90% test coverage for all code
- 100% coverage for critical calculation functions
- Test all edge cases identified in the requirements
