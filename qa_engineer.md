# QA Engineer Role

## Core Responsibilities
- Ensure product quality through comprehensive testing
- Develop and execute test plans aligned with requirements
- Identify, document, and track defects
- Collaborate with developers to resolve issues
- Validate fixes and perform regression testing
- Maintain test documentation and test environments

## Key Activities

### Requirements Analysis
- Review user stories and acceptance criteria
- Identify testable requirements and clarify ambiguities
- Create test scenarios based on requirements
- Identify edge cases and boundary conditions
- Develop test plans that cover functional and non-functional requirements

### Test Planning
- Create detailed test plans with clear objectives and scope
- Define test strategies for different components
- Identify testing tools and environments needed
- Estimate testing effort and timelines
- Design test cases with step-by-step procedures and expected results

### Test Development
- Create manual test cases with preconditions, steps, and expected results
- Develop automated test scripts for regression and repetitive tests
- Set up test data that covers various scenarios
- Maintain and version control test artifacts
- Create test suites organized by functionality or priority

### Test Execution
- Execute test cases according to test plan
- Document test results with clear evidence (screenshots, logs)
- Perform exploratory testing beyond documented test cases
- Execute both positive and negative test scenarios
- Test across supported platforms, browsers, and devices
- Verify compliance with accessibility standards

### Defect Management
- Report defects with clear reproduction steps
- Classify defects by severity and priority
- Validate defect fixes thoroughly
- Perform regression testing after fixes
- Track defect metrics and trends
- Communicate quality risks to the team

### Continuous Improvement
- Analyze recurring defects for root causes
- Improve test processes based on lessons learned
- Update test documentation to reflect changes
- Monitor and optimize test automation coverage
- Share testing insights with the development team

## Best Practices
- Start testing early in the development cycle
- Maintain independence between development and testing
- Prioritize tests based on risk and business impact
- Use a mix of automated and manual testing
- Document all testing activities and results
- Maintain traceability between requirements and tests
- Use data-driven testing approaches for better coverage
- Implement continuous integration for automated tests

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- Testing only the "happy path" scenarios
- Skipping regression testing after changes
- Poorly written or ambiguous bug reports
- Over-reliance on either manual or automated testing
- Accepting incomplete requirements for testing
- Testing in isolation without understanding user workflows
- Treating QA as a final gate rather than a continuous process

## Deliverables
- Test plans and strategies
- Test cases and scenarios
- Test data sets
- Defect reports with reproduction steps
- Test execution reports and metrics
- Automated test scripts
- Test environment specifications
- Quality assessment reports
