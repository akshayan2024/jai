# JAI API Roadmap

## Current Status
The JAI (Jyotish Astrological Interpretation) API is a REST API for Vedic astrological calculations. The initial implementation includes:

- Basic API structure with FastAPI
- Core astrological calculations:
  - Ascendant calculation
  - Natal chart (D1) generation
  - Divisional charts calculation
  - Mahadasha periods calculation
- Docker configuration for deployment

## Short-term Goals (1-3 months)

### Phase 1: Core Functionality Enhancement
- Implement complete Swiss Ephemeris integration
- Add nakshatra calculation service
- Implement planetary relationships (aspects)
- Add yogas identification service
- Create comprehensive test suite with fixtures

### Phase 2: API Extensions
- Add authentication and rate limiting
- Implement caching layer for better performance
- Create detailed API documentation with OpenAPI
- Add compatibility endpoints
- Implement progression calculations

## Mid-term Goals (3-6 months)

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Implement Ashtakavarga calculations
- Add Shadbala (planetary strength) calculations
- Create transit prediction endpoints
- Implement Tajika annual charts
- Add interpretation text generation for basic chart factors

### Phase 4: Integration and Expansion
- Create client SDK libraries (JavaScript, Python)
- Implement event-based subscription for transits
- Add webhooks for astrological events
- Create batch processing capabilities
- Implement data visualization endpoints

## Long-term Goals (6-12 months)

### Phase 5: Enterprise Features
- Implement multi-tenant architecture
- Add advanced security features
- Create admin dashboard
- Implement business analytics
- Add high availability infrastructure

### Phase 6: Research and Innovation
- Implement machine learning for pattern recognition
- Create prediction refinement algorithms
- Add historical correlation analysis
- Develop custom research endpoints
- Implement advanced interpretation engine

## Technical Debt and Maintenance
- Regular dependency updates
- Code refactoring for maintainability
- Performance optimization
- Security vulnerability monitoring
