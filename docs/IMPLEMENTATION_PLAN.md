## Implementation Approach

### Technical Architecture
1. **Service-based design**: Implement each major feature as a separate service
2. **Incremental development**: Complete one phase before moving to the next
3. **Test-driven development**: Create tests before implementing features
4. **Modular constants**: Store all astrological constants in dedicated files
5. **Clean API**: Design consistent, well-documented endpoints

### Development Process
1. **Setup core infrastructure** (Phase 1)
2. **Implement Swiss Ephemeris integration** for planetary calculations
3. **Build basic chart services** (ascendant, houses, natal chart)
4. **Add specialized services** in subsequent phases
5. **Continuous documentation** throughout development

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test each service function in isolation
- Verify astrological calculations against known examples
- Test edge cases (0° and 360° boundaries)

### Integration Testing
- Test API endpoints with various input combinations
- Verify data flow between services
- Test error handling and validation

### Validation Testing
- Compare results with established astrological software
- Verify calculation accuracy using real birth charts
- Establish acceptable precision thresholds

## Milestones and Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- **Week 1-2**: Project setup and Swiss Ephemeris integration
- **Week 3-4**: Basic planetary calculations and ascendant
- **Week 5**: Houses and retrograde detection
- **Week 6**: API documentation and validation

### Phase 2: Extended Functionality
- **Week 7-8**: Multiple ayanamsa support and nakshatras
- **Week 9-10**: D9 chart and divisional chart foundation
- **Week 11-12**: Mahadasha calculation system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- **Week 13-14**: Antardasha and current period calculations
- **Week 15-16**: Extended nakshatra features and aspects

### Phase 4: Premium Features
- **Week 17-19**: Shadbala and yoga calculations
- **Week 20-22**: Chart interpretation and compatibility

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Complex astrological calculations**: Mitigate with extensive testing against known examples
- **Swiss Ephemeris integration**: Start with a simple wrapper, then expand
- **Performance issues**: Implement caching for expensive calculations

### Resource Risks
- **Specialized knowledge required**: Document all astrological concepts thoroughly
- **Effort estimation uncertainty**: Build buffer time into each phase
- **Scope expansion**: Strictly prioritize features by user value

### Quality Risks
- **Calculation accuracy**: Validate against multiple reference sources
- **API usability**: Get early feedback from potential API consumers
- **Documentation quality**: Review documentation with both technical and astrological experts
