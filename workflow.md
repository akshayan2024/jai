# JAI API SDLC Workflow

Based on the existing project artifacts and structure, this document outlines a comprehensive Software Development Life Cycle workflow specifically tailored for the JAI API project.

## 1️⃣ Requirements & Planning Phase

**Inputs**: User stories, Technical specifications
**Activities**:
- Review existing `USER_STORIES.md` to understand complete feature set
- Reference `jai_api_spec_enriched.md` for technical requirements
- Prioritize features according to `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` phases
- Consult `ASTROLOGICAL_GLOSSARY.md` to understand domain concepts

**Outputs**:
- Updated `TASKS.md` with specific implementation tasks for current sprint
- Refined acceptance criteria for features

## 2️⃣ Design Phase

**Inputs**: Architecture document, Implementation plan
**Activities**:
- Study `ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand system components and data flow
- Design components according to the modular service structure
- Plan implementation according to phase requirements
- Apply principles from rules.md sections I-III for modularity and architecture

**Outputs**:
- Component specifications
- Service interface definitions
- Data models and schema definitions

## 3️⃣ Implementation Phase

**Inputs**: Tasks document, Developer setup, Architecture document
**Activities**:
- Set up development environment using `DEVELOPER_SETUP.md`
- Implement services in order of priority from `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Follow constants-first approach (implement mappings and constants)
- Apply Swiss Ephemeris integration
- Follow principles from rules.md sections X-XI for effective code editing

**Outputs**:
- Service implementations
- Constants definitions
- API endpoints

## 4️⃣ Testing Phase

**Inputs**: Testing strategy, User stories
**Activities**:
- Create test fixtures according to `TESTING.md`
- Implement unit tests for all service modules
- Create validation tests comparing against established software
- Test calculation accuracy at edge cases (0°, 360°)
- Apply principles from rules.md sections V and XIV-XVI for testing

**Outputs**:
- Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, validation)
- Test coverage reports
- Validated astrological calculations

## 5️⃣ Documentation Phase

**Inputs**: Glossary, Architecture, Implementation details
**Activities**:
- Update API documentation with endpoints and examples
- Document code with comprehensive docstrings
- Create astrological calculation references
- Create mappings between domain concepts and implementation
- Apply principles from rules.md section VII and XVII for documentation

**Outputs**:
- OpenAPI documentation at `/v1/docs`
- Code docstrings
- Updated glossary with implementation references

## 6️⃣ Deployment Phase

**Inputs**: Deployment guide, Testing results
**Activities**:
- Prepare Docker container
- Configure Render.com deployment pipeline
- Set up environment variables in Render dashboard
- Apply principles from rules.md section VI for deployment

**Outputs**:
- Deployed API with proper versioning
- Monitoring and logging
- Documentation endpoints

## 7️⃣ Maintenance and Enhancement Phase

**Inputs**: Roadmap, User feedback
**Activities**:
- Monitor API performance and logs
- Track issues and enhancement requests
- Plan next implementation phase according to `ROADMAP.md`
- Apply principles from rules.md sections II and XIII for change management

**Outputs**:
- Updated tasks for next phase
- Performance optimization plans
- Enhanced features

## Implementation-Specific Workflow Details

### Phase 1 Implementation Workflow (Current)

1. **Service Setup**:
   - Complete Swiss Ephemeris integration
   - Implement core planet positioning
   - Implement ascendant calculation

2. **Testing Approach**:
   - Create birth data fixtures
   - Validate against established software results
   - Test edge cases for sign boundaries

3. **API Development**:
   - Implement input validation
   - Create error handling structure
   - Develop basic endpoints

4. **Documentation Focus**:
   - Document API endpoints
   - Create detailed calculation explanations
   - Create developer onboarding guide

### Quality Gates

1. **Code Review**:
   - Follow PEP 8 styling
   - Verify adherence to rules.md
   - Check for constant usage vs. hard-coded values
   - Verify docstrings and comments

2. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Minimum 95% test coverage for core calculation modules
   - All edge cases covered
   - Validation against at least one reference implementation

3. **Deployment Criteria**:
   - All tests passing
   - Documentation complete
   - Performance benchmarks met

This workflow integrates the existing project structure, documentation, and development practices with the extended principles from the updated rules.md to create a comprehensive SDLC approach specific to the JAI API project.
