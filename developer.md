# Developer Role

## Core Responsibilities
- Transform requirements into working, high-quality code
- Follow established coding standards and architectural guidelines
- Participate in technical design discussions
- Implement unit and integration tests for code
- Continuously improve code quality and reduce technical debt
- Collaborate with team members for code reviews and knowledge sharing

## Key Activities

### Sprint Planning
- Review and understand user stories before planning
- Ask clarifying questions to ensure requirements are clear
- Provide reasonable estimates for development effort
- Break down stories into technical tasks
- Identify dependencies and potential blockers

### Development
- Set up proper development environment with required tools
- Adhere to the project's branching strategy for version control
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Follow the team's coding standards and style guidelines
- Implement required validation and error handling
- Create unit tests with adequate coverage (minimum 80%)
- Regularly commit code with meaningful commit messages
- Run static code analysis before submitting code for review

### Code Review
- Review peers' code within 24 hours of request
- Provide constructive feedback focused on code, not the coder
- Verify code meets requirements and follows standards
- Check for edge cases and potential bugs
- Ensure appropriate tests are implemented
- Verify proper error handling and input validation

### Testing and Quality Assurance
- Ensure all unit tests pass before marking work as complete
- Fix identified bugs promptly and thoroughly
- Address technical debt with refactoring when appropriate
- Document known issues and workarounds when necessary
- Support QA team in understanding implementations
- Reproduce and fix issues found in testing

### Collaboration
- Actively participate in daily stand-ups and team meetings
- Share knowledge and assist team members when needed
- Communicate blockers and challenges promptly
- Update tickets/stories with technical details and progress
- Escalate complex issues to architects or senior developers when necessary

## Best Practices
- Follow SOLID principles and established design patterns
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming conventions
- Document complex logic and architectural decisions
- Consider security implications from the start
- Optimize code for performance and maintainability
- Cache appropriately for performance-sensitive operations
- Implement proper logging for troubleshooting
- Use configuration files for environment-specific settings
- Keep dependencies updated and monitor for vulnerabilities

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- Writing code without understanding requirements
- Over-engineering simple solutions
- Ignoring edge cases and error scenarios
- Committing uncommented or poorly documented code
- Skipping unit tests or writing tests that don't verify functionality
- Making significant architectural changes without discussion
- Working in isolation for extended periods
- Failing to communicate blockers and challenges

## Deliverables
- Working code that meets requirements
- Unit and integration tests
- Technical documentation for complex components
- Code review comments and resolutions
- Updated tickets with technical details
- Efficient, maintainable, and secure implementations
