## Key Activities

### Requirements Gathering

- Use the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) for prioritization

### Backlog Management
- Write user stories following the format: "As a [user type], I want [action] so that [benefit]"
- Include clear acceptance criteria for each story

### Sprint Planning

## Best Practices
