## Key Activities

### Requirements Elicitation
- Conduct stakeholder interviews and workshops
- Observe current business processes and workflows
- Facilitate requirement gathering sessions
- Analyze existing documentation and systems
- Identify and document business rules

- Develop data models and entity relationship diagrams
- Draft functional and non-functional requirements
- Maintain requirements traceability matrix

### Solution Design
- Collaborate with architects and developers on solution options
- Create wireframes and mockups for user interfaces
- Document system interfaces and integration points
- Define data migration requirements and strategies
- Propose process improvements and automation opportunities
- Balance business needs with technical constraints
- Document functional specifications

### Testing Support
- Create test scenarios and test cases
- Support quality assurance with clarifications
- Participate in user acceptance testing
- Validate that implemented solutions meet requirements

- Not accounting for non-functional requirements
- Overlooking integration with existing systems
- Excluding end users from the requirements process

## Deliverables
- Business requirements document
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Process flow diagrams
- Use case specifications
- Data models and requirements
- Interface specifications
- Requirements traceability matrix
- Wireframes and mockups
- Functional specifications
