## Supported Versions

We are committed to maintaining the security of the JAI API. Below is information about which versions are currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Responsible Disclosure

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our open-source software. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them by emailing our security team at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com).

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Security Updates

When we learn of a security vulnerability, we will:

1. Confirm the vulnerability and determine the affected versions.
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
3. Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be released as quickly as possible.

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- All sensitive data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- Never log sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, or personal data.
- Use environment variables for configuration and secrets.

### Dependencies

- Keep all dependencies up to date.
- Use tools like `safety` and `dependabot` to monitor for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- Regularly audit dependencies for known security issues.

### Secure Development

- Follow the principle of least privilege.
- Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs.
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks.
- Use HTTPS for all communications.

## Security Updates and Notifications

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2). All security-related releases will include a security advisory in the release notes.

## Security Best Practices for Users

- Always use the latest version of the JAI API.
- Keep your Python environment and dependencies up to date.
- Use strong, unique passwords for any authentication.
- Implement rate limiting in production environments.
- Regularly back up your data.
- Monitor your application logs for suspicious activity.
