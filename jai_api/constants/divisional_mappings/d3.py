"""
D3 chart (Drekkana) mapping.
This mapping divides each sign into three equal parts (of 10째 each).
For the first drekkana (0-10째), it's mapped to the sign itself.
For the second drekkana (10-20째), it's mapped to the 5th sign from it (same element).
For the third drekkana (20-30째), it's mapped to the 9th sign from it (same element).
