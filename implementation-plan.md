# JAI API Refactoring Implementation Plan

## Current Project State
- **Stage**: Production
- **Focus**: Refactoring for maintainability, performance, and code quality
- **Key Issues**: Code duplication, inconsistent error handling, and architectural improvements needed

## Implementation Approach
We'll follow an incremental approach, making small, testable changes while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Phase 1: Setup and Infrastructure (Foundation)

### 1.1 Project Structure and Tooling
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks with black, isort, and flake8
- [ ] Configure mypy for static type checking
- [ ] Add pytest configuration for better test discovery
- [ ] Set up code coverage reporting

### 1.2 Documentation
- [ ] Update README with development setup instructions
- [ ] Document API endpoints with examples
- [ ] Add architecture decision records (ADRs) for major changes

## Phase 2: Core Refactoring

### 2.1 Centralize Common Functionality
- [ ] Create a shared utilities module for common functions
- [ ] Standardize error handling across the application
- [ ] Implement consistent logging configuration

### 2.2 Service Layer Improvements
- [ ] Refactor calculation service for better separation of concerns
- [ ] Implement caching for expensive calculations
- [ ] Add retry logic for external service calls

### 2.3 API Layer Improvements
- [ ] Standardize response formats
- [ ] Implement consistent error responses
- [ ] Add request validation middleware

## Phase 3: Testing and Quality

### 3.1 Unit Tests
- [ ] Add unit tests for core calculation functions
- [ ] Test edge cases in date/time handling
- [ ] Test coordinate validation

### 3.2 Integration Tests
- [ ] Test API endpoints with real requests
- [ ] Test geocoding service integration
- [ ] Test timezone handling

### 3.3 Performance Testing
- [ ] Profile critical paths
- [ ] Optimize database queries (if any)
- [ ] Implement caching where beneficial

## Phase 4: Documentation and Polish

### 4.1 API Documentation
- [ ] Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] Add example requests and responses
- [ ] Document rate limiting and authentication

### 4.2 Developer Documentation
- [ ] Document the development workflow
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines
- [ ] Document deployment process

## Phase 5: Deployment and Monitoring

### 5.1 Deployment
- [ ] Update Docker configuration
- [ ] Document deployment process
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

### 5.2 Monitoring
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
- [ ] Set up logging and monitoring
- [ ] Configure alerts for critical errors

## Tracking Progress

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Initial implementation plan created

### In Progress
- [ ] Setting up development environment

### Up Next
- [ ] Configure pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Set up testing framework

## Notes
- Each change should be accompanied by appropriate tests
- Follow semantic versioning for releases
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document any breaking changes

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI
- pydantic
- pyswisseph
- pytest
- black, isort, flake8
